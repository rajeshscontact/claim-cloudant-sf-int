						<h2>FAQs</h2>
						<h4 class="faqsQuestion">Q: Why did you decide to create CodeSoju?</h4>
						<h4 class="faqsAnswer">A: While working on Enterprise apps we noticed that developers often have to maintain just one or two parts of the development cycle. It is very hard to build something from the scratch and make it robust so it can easily grow if some pieces in the understanding are missing. It is important to keep in mind and to understand the big picture.</h4>
						<h4 class="faqsQuestion">Q: Why did you chose Node, Angular, Angular2, Typescript, Angular Material?</h4>
						<h4 class="faqsAnswer">A: The experience shows that Node and Angular are very robust and widely used technologies. We love to explore technologies and we see that Angular2 with Typescript and Angular Material2 are rapidly developing and we think it will grow even faster in the future.</h4>
						<h4 class="faqsQuestion">Q: Can I create my app with CodeSoju?</h4>
						<h4 class="faqsAnswer">A: Absolutely! CodeSoju provides you with Yeoman generators to create a scaffold of your app ready to run on multiple devices. It provides you with tools, standards  and documentation. It covers the deployment phase as well. It is designed to make you life as a developer easier. So, of course you can!</h4>
